# Deliverable 3
## Overview of Project 
### Background
There is a upcoming playright Louise, she wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help heal fever. 
Her estimate budget is over 10000 dollars  
### Purpose 
Organize, sort and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that can 
make crowdfunding campaign successful. Help Louise gain a greater unserstanding of crowdfunding campaigns, 
so her campaign will have more chance to be successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis 
I analysis this dataset by carefully follow the instructions in module 1, also searched some informations about 
kickstarter and crowdfunding campaign, they are totally new to me. Also, I analysis my results by using images, 
I selected appropriate x-axis and y-aixs and scales, therefore, the trend of data is clear. 
### Challenges
#### 1. 
Made a mistake while coding, really tiny mistake all over my analysis, which made my result different from the 
instruction, I carefully checked my work and finally find it, but I don't know how to change it at once, so I modified 
this mistake from cell to cell. 
#### 2.
Also I accidentally changed some data of the kickstarter file by misclicking. Then I downloaded the original file again 
and changed it back. 

## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49871539/116801778-cf278c00-aada-11eb-89ce-681ac3b393f2.png)
#### 1 
Most successful campaigns are launch in May. 
#### 2 
At the end of a year, campaigns are less likely to success. 

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49871539/116801829-465d2000-aadb-11eb-9d46-d697dbd8ed4e.png)
If we set the goal to a small amount, then the campaign is more likely to succeed. However, 
there is a strange uprising when the goal amount is about 35000 to 40000. 

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset is not large enough, this problem is more serious when we have more filters. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I think the success rate of campaigns are somehow related to regions. 
So, I would like to draw a graph of Outcomes vs Country.
